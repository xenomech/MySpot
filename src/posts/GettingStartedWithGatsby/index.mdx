## What is Gatsby?

Gatsby is a static site generator(SSG), which uses React and GraphQL. It is considered to be a complete front-end solution.

## What is an SSG?

An SSG takes in templates, components, data and provides you with a static HTML page.

## What is a Gatsby starter site?

The easiest way to get started with gatsby is to use a starter template from the [Gatsby Starter Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/?).
These are preset gatsby projects which have everything already configured and ready for use. What we want is a barebone starter which is called "hello-world"!
So, now we need to create a new gatsby site from the starter.

```shell
    gatsby new [YOUR-PROJECT-NAME] https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```

[_Setting up the Gatsby development environment_](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-zero/)

Now cd into the folder and run "npm start" or "gatsby develop"!

```shell
    cd [YOUR-PROJECT-NAME]
```

```shell
    npm start
```

or

```shell
    gatsby develop
```

now the starter site is live on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## What's inside?

Ok, now we can see what is inside the project folder.

```

+-> node_modules
+-> public
+-> src
 |_-> pages
    |_->index.js
+-> static

```

- "node_modules" is the folder where all the packages get installed.
- The "public" folder is generated when we run "gatsby develop" or "npm start" inside here is all of the stuff that is served
- Most of the work you do will be inside the src/ folder.
- The "static" folder holds any static files that our website needs.

let us take a look at the index.js inside src/pages

## Pages and Routes

```js
import React from "react"

export default function Home() {
  return <div>Hello world!</div>
}
```

Gatsby has a built-in way of setting up routes with the help of the files present in the pages folder.
For example, we have an _index.js_ this will be served at the "/" (root route) of the website that is this is what you see first.

If we create another file, say _about. js_ which contains:

```js
import React from "react"

export default function About() {
  return <div>the about page</div>
}
```

this is accessible at /about which is [http://localhost:8000/about](http://localhost:8000/about)

The same happens if you create folders inside the pages folder, for example, create a file inside "projects" folder _/projects/myfirstproject.js_

this is accessible at /projects/myfirstproject that is [http://localhost:8000/projects/myfirstproject](http://localhost:8000/projects/myfirstproject)

## Nav and Link from Gatsby

So, to access those routes we talked about, we need to have a navbar or at least an <a> tag!

1. To make a navbar

Create a file called Navbar.js inside src/components and create a react component.

```js
import React from "react"
export const Navbar = () => {
  return (

  )
}
```

In Gatsby, there is something called "Link" which can be imported from "gatsby"!

```js
import React from "react"
import {Link} from "gatsby"
export const Navbar = () => {
  return (

  )
}
```

now we need to specify on clicking which text the routing should occur

```js
import React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"
export const Navbar = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/about">about</Link>
      <Link to="/projects/myfirstproject">My first project</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

now in the _index.js_

```js
import React from "react"
import Navbar from "../componets/navbar"
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar />
      hello World!s
    </div>
  )
}
```
